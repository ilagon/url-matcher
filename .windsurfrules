## Additional Considerations for the Agentic AI

- Modularity: Encourage the AI to break down the task into smaller, manageable functions or modules (e.g., clean_urls(), exact_match(), partial_match(), generate_report()).

- Parameterization: Design the script to be flexible by using parameters for file paths, matching thresholds, and matching strategies.

- Logging and Error Handling: Implement robust logging to track progress, record decisions, and handle potential errors gracefully.

- Efficiency: Optimize the code for performance, especially when dealing with large datasets (e.g., using vectorized operations instead of loops where possible).

- Testability: Promote writing unit tests to ensure the correctness of individual functions and the overall matching logic.

- Clarity and Readability: Emphasize the importance of clean, well-documented code that is easy to understand and maintain.

- Iterative Development: Encourage the AI to follow an iterative approach, starting with basic exact matching and gradually adding more sophisticated partial matching techniques.

- User Feedback: Build in mechanisms for the AI to request clarification or feedback on specific matching decisions or parameters.
