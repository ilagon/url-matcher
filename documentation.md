Development Plan

## Step 1: Data Preparation

Clean URLs:
Remove any leading/trailing whitespace from URLs in both columns.
Standardize URL formatting (e.g., ensure consistent use of trailing slashes, remove redundant slashes, handle URL encoding).
Handle Missing Values:
Decide how to handle rows with missing URLs (e.g., skip them, log them, or fill them with a placeholder).
Create a Working Copy:
Create a copy of the DataFrame to perform matching operations, preserving the original data.

## Step 2: Exact Matching

Perform Exact Match:
Directly compare Live URLs and Staging URLs columns.
Create a new column (e.g., Match Type) and label exact matches as "Exact".
Store Exact Matches:
Store the matched pairs in a separate data structure (e.g., a dictionary or a new DataFrame) for reporting or further processing.
Remove Exact Matches:
Remove the exactly matched rows from the working copy of the DataFrame to optimize subsequent partial matching.

## Step 3: Partial Matching

Define Partial Matching Logic:
This is the core of the challenge and requires careful consideration. Here are a few strategies:
Substring Matching: Check if the Live URL is a substring of any Staging URL or vice versa. This is a basic approach but can be useful.
Path-Based Matching: Split URLs into their path components and compare segments. For example, /products/shoes might partially match /products.
Tokenization and Similarity: Tokenize URLs (split into words or parts) and use similarity metrics (e.g., Jaccard index, cosine similarity) to find close matches.
Regular Expressions: Use regular expressions to define patterns for matching (e.g., matching URLs with the same base path but different parameters).
Implement Partial Matching Algorithm:
Choose one or a combination of the above strategies and implement it in Python. This might involve nested loops or vectorized operations for efficiency.
Label Partial Matches:
In the Match Type column, label the partial matches (e.g., "Partial - Substring", "Partial - Path", etc.) to indicate the type of partial match.
Store Partial Matches:
Store the partially matched pairs in the data structure, along with their match types.

## Step 4: Handling Unmatched URLs

Identify Unmatched URLs:
After exact and partial matching, identify the Live URLs that still have no match.
Decide on Action:
Log these unmatched URLs for review.
Attempt more aggressive matching techniques if appropriate.
Mark them as "No Match" in the Match Type column.

## Step 5: Output and Reporting

Consolidate Results:
Combine the exact matches, partial matches, and unmatched URLs into a single output data structure.
Generate Report:
Create a clear report showing the matching results. This could be:
A new CSV file with Live URLs, Staging URLs, and Match Type columns.
A summary table with statistics on the number of exact matches, partial matches (by type), and unmatched URLs.
A detailed log of all matches and any issues encountered.
